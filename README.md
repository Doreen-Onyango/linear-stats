# Linear Regression Analysis in Go

This project implements linear regression analysis on a dataset provided as a file. It calculates the slope and intercept of the best-fit line and computes the Pearson correlation coefficient for the data.

## Features

- Calculate the slope and intercept of a linear regression line.
- Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables.
- Handle data input from a specified file.

## Requirements

- Go programming language
- A data file containing numerical values.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/doonyango/linear-stats.git
cd linear-stats
```

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go input.txt
```
## Data Format
The program expects a data file containing numerical values, one value per line. For example:
```
1.0
2.5
3.0
4.5
5.0
```
